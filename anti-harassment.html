<p>Pirateship is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. With regards to these guidelines and general decency, members are in no way superior to non-members and have no "rights" that supercede the imperative to maintain these (very basic and probably incomplete) guidelines.</p>
<p>These guidelines are meant to encourage decent behavior in all Pirateship spaces, including our mailing lists and IRC channel, both online and off. They aren't complete in any way, and anyone in the Pirateship should anticipate individual addendums or subtractions from anyone else, and those ideas should be respected.</p>
<p>Some Pirateship events may have rules in place, which will be made clear to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by those rules. Participation in any gathering in the space should be considered neither compulsory nor implicit.</p>
<p>Anyone may consent to any of the behaviors listed below. This consent, and all "yes"s, are conditional and revokable. All indications of "No", "Stop", "Maybe", "Not now", "Go away", silence, or walking away are unconditional negations, so cut it out.</p>
<br />
<p>Harassment includes:</p>
<p>Unwanted comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.</p>
<br />
<p>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle, skills, and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, relationships, hobbies, and employment.</p>
<br />
<p>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</p>
<br />
<p>Nonreciprocal expressions of sexual interest, gratuitous sexual language or imagery without consent of those present, or violating a present individuals' triggers without warning.</p>
<br />
<p>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.</p>
<br />
<p>Threats of violence</p>
<br />
<p>Destruction or manipulation of personal property in a targeted manner, including ethereal property such as data</p>
<br />
<p>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</p>
<br />
<p>Deliberate intimidation</p>
<br />
<p>Stalking or following</p>
<br />
<p>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</p>
<br />
<p>Sustained disruption or interruption of work, conversation, or activity</p>
<br />
<p>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</p>
<br />
<p>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</p>
<br />
<p>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse</p>
<br />
<p>Publication of non-harassing private communication</p>
<br />
<p>Pirateship has worked hard to diversify, and has done so in part by placing marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will probably ignore complaints regarding:</p>
<br />
<p>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</p>
<br />
<p>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</p>
<br />
<p>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</p>
<br />
<p>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</p>
<br />
<p>Telling someone:</p>
<br />
<p>If you are being harassed by a member of Pirateship, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the pirateship mailing list or an individual member.</p>
<br />
<p>These guidelines apply to Pirateship spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Pirateship outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We should acknowledge all good-faith reports of harassment by Pirateship members. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. As humans, we have the personal right to judge others based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Pirateship spaces and behavior towards people who are not members.</p>
<br />
<p>Accusations of harassment should not be made in a retaliatory manner, nor should they be used to silence dissent or lessen criticisms of one's own behavior.</p>
<br />
<p>Any member may publicly name a person about whom they’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if they believe that doing so is the right thing to do. No person anywhere should name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
<br />
<p>People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<br />
<p>People violating these guidelines may be temporarily expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of any Pirateship member.</p>
<br />
<p>People who don't understand these guidelines are expected to Google it.</p>
